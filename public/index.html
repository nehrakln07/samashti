      content="Samashti foundation is a not-for-profit social cause organization started for two main reasons. First, to transition farmers to Sustainable Organic Farming and second, to increase the overall livelihood of farmers.
      We aim to achieve these goals by raising funds on a village by village basis to create village level and farmer level infrastructure required for Organic Farming, in collaboration with grassroot level organizations like BERU Community that are working directly with farmers.
      Furthermore, we plan to enable an ecosystem of farm inputs, access to government subsidies and implementing technology for farm management by collaborating with various stake holders thereby making transition and organic farming sustainable"

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
